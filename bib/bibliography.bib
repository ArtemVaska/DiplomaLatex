  abstract = {Long considered the quintessential molecular biology textbook, for decades Lewin's Genes has provided the most modern presentation to this transformative and dynamic science. Now in its twelfth edition, this classic text continues to lead with new information and cutting-edge developments, covering gene structure, sequencing, organization, and expression. Leading scientists provide revisions and updates in their respective areas of study offering readers current research and relevant information on the rapidly changing subjects in molecular biology. No other text offers a broader understanding of this exciting and vital science or does so with higher quality art and illustrations. Lewin's Genes XII continues to be the clear choice for molecular biology and genetics.},

               provides mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We
               described several testis-specific transcripts of the Drosophila
               melanogaster nxf1 gene designated ``sbr'' in this species via
               different PCR approaches and CAGE-seq analysis.
               Characteristically, most of them have truncated 3′UTRs compared
               with those in other organs. In addition to regular transcripts,
               there are shorter transcripts that begin in intron 3 of the sbr
               gene. These short, 5′-truncated testis-specific transcripts vary
               in terms of transcription start site and their ability to
               exclude or retain the last 237 nucleotides of intron 3 in their
               5′UTR. Using an anti-SBR antibody against the C-terminal portion
               of this protein, we detected the major SBR protein (74 kDa) in
               all analyzed organs of the fly as well as a new smaller protein
               (60 kDa) found only in the testes. This protein corresponds to
               the detected sbr transcripts that start in intron 3, based on
               its molecular mass. We investigated the sbr12 allele of the sbr
               gene, which is lethal in homozygous females and causes dominant
               sterility in heterozygous males. Sequencing of the sbr12 gene
               allele revealed a 30-bp deletion in exon 9 without a frame
               shift.Western blot analysiswith an SBR-specific antibody
               revealed two bands of the expected size in the testes of
               heterozygous males. Thus, a mutant protein along with the normal
               protein presents in the testes of lethal allele-bearing flies
               and the described shorter testis-specific variant of SBR may
               account for male sterility.",

  abstract = {A fundamental breakthrough in neurobiology has been the formulation of the neuron doctrine by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, which stated that the nervous system is composed of discrete cells. Electron microscopy later confirmed the doctrine and allowed the identification of synaptic connections. In this work, we used volume electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions to characterize the nerve net of a ctenophore, a marine invertebrate that belongs to one of the earliest-branching animal lineages. We found that neurons in the subepithelial nerve net have a continuous plasma membrane that forms a syncytium. Our findings suggest fundamental differences of nerve net architectures between ctenophores and cnidarians or bilaterians and offer an alternative perspective on neural network organization and neurotransmission. The evolutionary origin of nervous systems remains a fundamental question in biology. A hallmark of nervous systems is that they are composed of discrete cells (neurons) that communicate through synapses. Ctenophores, a sister group to all animals with nervous systems, play a key role in comparative studies into the evolutionary origin(s) of neurons and their connections. To establish neuronal circuits that facilitate ctenophore behavior, Burkhardt et al. used high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, revealing that nerve-net neurons are not separate entities, but rather are interconnected through continuous neurite plasma membranes without evidence of synapses (see the Perspective by Dunn). The findings offer a new perspective on the evolution of neuronal networks and neurotransmission. —MMa Ctenophores, a class of marine invertebrates, show evidence of an independently evolved distinctive syncitial nervous system.},
