               provides mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We
               described several testis-specific transcripts of the Drosophila
               melanogaster nxf1 gene designated ``sbr'' in this species via
               different PCR approaches and CAGE-seq analysis.
               Characteristically, most of them have truncated 3′UTRs compared
               with those in other organs. In addition to regular transcripts,
               there are shorter transcripts that begin in intron 3 of the sbr
               gene. These short, 5′-truncated testis-specific transcripts vary
               in terms of transcription start site and their ability to
               exclude or retain the last 237 nucleotides of intron 3 in their
               5′UTR. Using an anti-SBR antibody against the C-terminal portion
               of this protein, we detected the major SBR protein (74 kDa) in
               all analyzed organs of the fly as well as a new smaller protein
               (60 kDa) found only in the testes. This protein corresponds to
               the detected sbr transcripts that start in intron 3, based on
               its molecular mass. We investigated the sbr12 allele of the sbr
               gene, which is lethal in homozygous females and causes dominant
               sterility in heterozygous males. Sequencing of the sbr12 gene
               allele revealed a 30-bp deletion in exon 9 without a frame
               shift.Western blot analysiswith an SBR-specific antibody
               revealed two bands of the expected size in the testes of
               heterozygous males. Thus, a mutant protein along with the normal
               protein presents in the testes of lethal allele-bearing flies
               and the described shorter testis-specific variant of SBR may
               account for male sterility.",

               studies. Our attention was drawn to the conservative intron of
               the Nxf1 (nuclear export factor) gene. This intron is a part of
               an evolutionarily conserved block formed with flanking 110 bp
               and 37 bp exons, similar in representatives of various taxonomic
               groups. This evolutionary conservative block in our previous
               works was designated cassette intron. The Nxf1 genes are found
               in all representatives of Opisthokonta, and may be a convenient
               object for phylogenetic studies. The Nxf1 gene sequences of
               seventeen representatives of the order Chiroptera obtained from
               publicly available databases (ensembl, ncbi). Alignment

               Maximum Likelihood and Bayes Inference. The use of Nxf1 gene
               sequences that include only exons or only introns leads to
               unequal loss of accuracy in establishing evolutionary
               relationships in comparison with the model based on the complete
               gene sequence. Sequences involving all exons plus a cassette
               intron give the same result as the complete Nxf1 gene sequence.

  abstract = {A fundamental breakthrough in neurobiology has been the formulation of the neuron doctrine by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, which stated that the nervous system is composed of discrete cells. Electron microscopy later confirmed the doctrine and allowed the identification of synaptic connections. In this work, we used volume electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions to characterize the nerve net of a ctenophore, a marine invertebrate that belongs to one of the earliest-branching animal lineages. We found that neurons in the subepithelial nerve net have a continuous plasma membrane that forms a syncytium. Our findings suggest fundamental differences of nerve net architectures between ctenophores and cnidarians or bilaterians and offer an alternative perspective on neural network organization and neurotransmission. The evolutionary origin of nervous systems remains a fundamental question in biology. A hallmark of nervous systems is that they are composed of discrete cells (neurons) that communicate through synapses. Ctenophores, a sister group to all animals with nervous systems, play a key role in comparative studies into the evolutionary origin(s) of neurons and their connections. To establish neuronal circuits that facilitate ctenophore behavior, Burkhardt et al. used high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, revealing that nerve-net neurons are not separate entities, but rather are interconnected through continuous neurite plasma membranes without evidence of synapses (see the Perspective by Dunn). The findings offer a new perspective on the evolution of neuronal networks and neurotransmission. —MMa Ctenophores, a class of marine invertebrates, show evidence of an independently evolved distinctive syncitial nervous system.},
